# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# 3d Packages

```
"@react-spring/three"
"@react-three/drei"
"@react-three/fiber"
```

## Notes from the course:

- The 3d models can be downloaded in [this Page](https://sketchfab.com/feed) in format GLTF
- Afterwards we need to transform the model in a valid 3d react component in [this other page](https://gltf.pmnd.rs/)
